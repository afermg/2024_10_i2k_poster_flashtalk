  abstract = {Image-based profiling has emerged as a powerful technology for various steps in basic biological and pharmaceutical discovery, but the community has lacked a large, public reference set of data from chemical and genetic perturbations. Here we present data generated by the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling (JUMP)-Cell Painting Consortium, a collaboration between 10 pharmaceutical companies, six supporting technology companies, and two non-profit partners. When completed, the dataset will contain images and profiles from the Cell Painting assay for over 116,750 unique compounds, over-expression of 12,602 genes, and knockout of 7,975 genes using CRISPR-Cas9, all in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS). The dataset is estimated to be 115 TB in size and capturing 1.6 billion cells and their single-cell profiles. File quality control and upload is underway and will be completed over the coming months at the Cell Painting Gallery: https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery. A portal to visualize a subset of the data is available at https://phenaid.ardigen.com/jumpcpexplorer/.},

  abstract = {High-throughput image-based profiling platforms are powerful technologies capable of collecting data from billions of cells exposed to thousands perturbations in a time- and cost-effective manner. Therefore, image-based profiling data has been increasingly used for diverse biological applications, such as predicting drug mechanism of action or gene function. However, batch effects pose severe limitations to community-wide efforts to integrate and interpret image-based profiling data collected across different laboratories and equipment. To address this problem, we evaluated seven top-ranked batch correction strategies for mRNA profiles in the context of a newly released Cell Painting dataset, the largest publicly accessible image-based dataset. We focused on five different use scenarios with varying complexity, and found that Harmony, a nonlinear method, consistently outperformed the other tested methods. Furthermore, we provide a framework, benchmark, and metrics for the future assessment of new batch correction methods. Overall, this work paves the way for improvements that allow the community to make best use of public Cell Painting data for scientific discovery.},

  abstract = {Image-based profiling is a maturing strategy by which the rich information present in biological images is reduced to a multidimensional profile, a collection of extracted image-based features. These profiles can be mined for relevant patterns, revealing unexpected biological activity that is useful for many steps in the drug discovery process. Such applications include identifying disease-associated screenable phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms and predicting a drug's activity, toxicity or mechanism of action. Several of these applications have been recently validated and have moved into production mode within academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Some of these have yielded disappointing results in practice but are now of renewed interest due to improved machine-learning strategies that better leverage image-based information. Although challenges remain, novel computational technologies such as deep learning and single-cell methods that better capture the biological information in images hold promise for accelerating drug discovery.},
