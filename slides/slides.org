* Overview of the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling

* This results in hundreds of thousands of morphological profiles

* Data availability does not guarantee accessibility
Our current goal is to increase its usability and accessibility for both biologists and data scientists.

If a dataset falls in a forest and it is not heard, did it really fall?

* A big dataset comes with big responsibilities
We developed multiple tools to answer our biological questions.
We provide in-browser querying and visualisation tools, but also python libraries for ease of access to images and metadata.

Given gene X:
- How do the cells look?
- Which genes' KO/overexpression produce a similar phenotype?
- Which features are statistically better represented?
